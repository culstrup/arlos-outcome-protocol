# Website Test Results

## Positive Changes Observed
- Navigation anchors fixed: top-menu and buttons smoothly scroll to the right sections.
- Phase progression works: LinkedIn Growth Market Simulation advances through Private → Public → Execution → Verification → Resolved with appropriate colors.
- Private phase enhancements: trading interface and Linked Content tab support buying/selling shares, real-time updates, and access requests.
- Request Access feedback: submitted requests appear under "Access Requests" with status.

## Remaining Usability Issues
- **Trading interface visibility:** Later phases display only reputation cards; add guidance or functionality for Public, Execution, Verification, and Resolved phases.
- **Linked Content – View Content:** "View Content" button does nothing; enable viewing/downloading or clarify that sponsor approval is required.
- **Market Analysis & Reputation tabs:** Do not update beyond Private phase; populate with evolving metrics and reputation scores.
- **User feedback when actions blocked:** Calls to action use `mailto:` links which may be blocked; provide on-site contact form or copy email to clipboard.
- **Minor layout/contrast issues:** Hero typography overlaps on small screens and light grey text reduces readability; adjust font sizes and contrast.
- **Origin story link:** Footer link points to X/Twitter and is obstructed by sign-up prompts; host content on an accessible site.

## Overall Assessment
Navigation and phase progression issues were resolved, and the Private phase demonstrates core concepts effectively. Later phases feel unfinished and require explanatory text or functionality. Addressing usability gaps, improving CTAs, and refining UI elements will make the site feel more complete.
